Gender-Based Violence: Women and girls in India often face various forms of violence, including domestic violence, sexual harassment, rape, dowry-related violence, and honour killings.
These issues contribute significantly to the gender inequality landscape.
Nearly one-third of women in India have experienced physical or sexual violence, according to the National Family Health Survey-5 report.
Unequal Access to Education: Despite efforts to improve education access, disparities still exist between boys and girls in terms of enrollment, retention, and completion rates.
Cultural norms, economic constraints, and safety concerns often hinder girls' education.
Invisible Labour: Women in India often perform a significant amount of unpaid care work, including household chores, childcare, and eldercare, which is often overlooked and undervalued, contributing to their economic dependency and time poverty.
Gender Wage Gap: Women in India generally earn less than men for similar work, reflecting a significant gender wage gap.
This gap is prevalent across various sectors and levels of employment.
According to the estimates of the World Inequality Report 2022, in India, men earn 82% of the labour income, whereas women earn 18% of it.
Child Marriage: Child marriage disproportionately affects girls, depriving them of educational and economic opportunities and exposing them to health risks.
According to UNESCO, one in three of the world’s child brides live in India.
Child brides include girls under 18 who are already married, as well as women of all ages who first married in childhood.
The prevalence of child marriage has reduced by half from 47% in 2006 to 23.3% during 2019-21 (NFHS-5).
However, a few States such as Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Jharkhand, Rajasthan, Telangana, Tripura and West Bengal have higher prevalence of child marriage than the national average.
